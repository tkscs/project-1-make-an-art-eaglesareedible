# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like

I want to draw a dog face.

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?

The dog's eye and fur could be random colors, and if I want to I could make the shape of the ears either round or sharp.

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?
The ears, the eyes, and the actual face shape is similar to the shape of the nose actually.

4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?
The face is definitely a clear section along with the ears, the details would be the nose and the eyes. 

5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?

I really don't think there is much opportunity for loops in my sketch, if this is a problem, I can try and do a different proposal entirely but for now, there is mostly two of each detail so I could create functions for the details to make it look a lot nicer like, drawEar, or drawEye, or etc
